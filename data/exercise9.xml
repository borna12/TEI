            <salute>Sir,</salute></opener>
         
         <p>I find that my husband Mr <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1200811"><forename>Desmond</forename> <surname>Fitzgerald</surname></persName>, left <rs type="place">Mount
            joy Prison</rs>, on <date type="day">Friday</date> last so that he could not have received my 1
            letter before his departure. I had been told at the Prison that he
            would be able to write me and to receive one letter within the
            first week. I waited to write him till I should have had his letter
            which came on <date type="day">Friday</date> morning: I posted my reply on <date type="day">Friday</date> after
            <time type="noon">noon</time>.</p>
         
         <p>I have just heard from him again from <rs type="place" ref="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dartmoor">Dartmoor</rs> : it
            appears they are permitted to write once and receive a letter
            after arrival there.</p>
         
         <p>I think it very likely that my letter to my husband
            was forwarded on from <rs type="place">Mountjoy</rs> in which case he fears that it
            may count as the letter he has the right to receive in <rs type="place">Dartmoor</rs>.
            I shall be very much obliged if you will write the <roleName>Governor</roleName> of <rs type="place" ref="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dartmoor">Dartmoor</rs>
            explaining matters so that he may be given the letter which
            I am now writing him to <rs type="place">Dartmoor</rs>. As the he will not have another
            letter for four months I am anxious that he should not lose this
            one through a mistake.</p>
